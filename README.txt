# Alexa-Final
My skill is used for those who want to play trivia about the Olympics. In order to get her to ask you a question, all you have to say is "Alexa open Olympic Trivia and give me trivia" she will then ask you a question and wait for your response. After you respond to her, she will tell you if your answer was right or wrong. Alexa already knows 10 Olympic Trivia questions.
