Design
In order for my Alexa Skill to work I needed to create 2 arrays, one containing all of the trivia questions and another containing all of the answers. When the user wanted to access the skill they needed to tell Alexa that they wanted to open Olympic Trivia and to give them trivia. From here, I then needed to create a function that would randomly pick a question from the array. The random generator would pick a number in the range of the number of questions and select one to ask. It would then ask the user the chosen question and wait for their response. 
After this function was completed, another function needed to be created in order for Alexa to take in the user's answer. Once the question was asked, the user was then able to state their answer. That answer was then set to a temporary variable that was compared to the correct answer that was listed in the array. This function included an if statement where it would compare the temporary variable to the position of the correct answer and see if the user's answer was right. After this if statement was completed, Alexa would then be able to tell you whether or not your answer was correct. After this question was completed the user was able to tell Alexa the same statement to open the Olympic Trivia code and get asked a new question.
